# Discord Bot
*This currently isn't available to be deployed for the public. If you would like to have it in your own Discord server, you must set it up on your own*

## Features
- A Discord Bot trained with a GPT-2 model and stored on Hugging Face
- It randomly interjects into your Discord conversation by mocking the last thing said (using text completion). Vulgar phrases and emojis are added to every message sent out.
  - This goes off of the simple observation that the word "fucking" can be placed in front of any noun and be grammatically correct. Which can easily be accomplished with natural language processing
- sending a `#` followed by a key word will trigger the bot to web scrape a stock image of that keyword, process the image, and caption it with a random pinned message from the server.
- You can also command it with `!inspire` to send out an inspirational photo from a set of user uploaded insirational photos
